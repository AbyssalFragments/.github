Abyssal Fragments is a nonprofit LLC dedicated to fostering supportive online communities for individuals navigating mental health journeys.

Our core mission is to create a permanent, safe digital space where people can connect authentically, share experiences, and uplift one another through mutual understanding.

We go beyond traditional forums by hosting immersive gatherings in virtual reality, where members can find solace and solidarity in a dynamic environment.

Through charity initiatives, community giveaways, and moderated events, we actively work to build a culture of positivity, practical support, and genuine human connection.
